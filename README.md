# chess
Chess project from TOP (final Ruby Course project)

Game is finalized, GG. This took way more that expected, but it's rewarding....oh how it's rewarding. GG to fucking infinity.

Files inside lib/cleaned_up is just lib/chess.rb split in multiple .rb files. They don't and shouldn't work.


** If you want to play the game, run lib/chess.rb and enjoy. (*instructions inside*) **
